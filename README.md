This repository contains configuration packages of various quadrupedal robots generated by CHAMP's [setup assistant](https://github.com/chvmp/champ).

You can find the download links for every robot in install_descriptions if you want to install the URDF individually. Alternatively, you can run:

    ./install_descriptions

to download all URDFs at once.

Please take note that only the following pre-configured robots work in Gazebo:

- Open Quadruped
- OpenDog V2
- MIT Mini Cheetah
